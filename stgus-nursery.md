## What is the vision?

We love life on the land and I want to go back home when I can. I would also like to make a more concrete contribution to the regeneration of my home place. Having access to family resources makes this potentially more possible than it would be otherwise. Additionally, though I love to teach and enjoy many aspects of it, higher education is a declining and fragile industry that asks a lot of me and makes work on the land difficult.
